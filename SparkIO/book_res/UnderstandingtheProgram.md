Your program demonstrates a simple client-server interaction using Netty, a popular asynchronous networking library. In this scenario, a Netty server listens for incoming chunk fetch requests, processes them, and responds back to the client with the requested data. The client initiates fetch requests for data chunks by sending `ChunkFetchRequest` messages to the server. Upon receiving a request, the server responds with `ChunkFetchResponse` messages containing the data for the requested chunk. This exchange is facilitated through a custom protocol defined by `MessageType`, `ChunkFetchRequest`, and `ChunkFetchResponse` classes.

### Understanding the Program

1. **Server Setup and Start**: The `NettyServer` class initializes a server on a specified port. It configures the server to handle incoming connections, decode requests, encode responses, and process fetch requests through the `ServerHandler`.

2. **Client Requests**: The `NettyClient` class connects to the server and sends a series of fetch requests for data chunks, identified by a chunk ID. It continuously sends these requests in a loop, simulating a client fetching data chunks from the server.

3. **Message Handling**: 
   
   - The `MessageDecoder` class decodes incoming bytes into `ChunkFetchRequest` or `ChunkFetchResponse` objects, based on the message type.
   - The `MessageEncoder` class encodes these objects back into bytes for transmission over the network.

4. **Request and Response Processing**: 
   
   - The `ServerHandler` processes each `ChunkFetchRequest`, generating a `ChunkFetchResponse` with dummy data.
   - The `ClientHandler` receives the `ChunkFetchResponse` and prints out the chunk ID and data to the console.

### Explanation of the Message Output

The log output you see is generated by Netty's `LoggingHandler` and SLF4J. It provides a detailed view of the byte-level communication between the client and server. Here's a breakdown:

- **WRITE and READ Logs**: These entries show the binary data written to and read from the network.
  
  - `WRITE`: Indicates data being sent by the server.
  - `READ`: Indicates data being received by the client.

- **Byte Representation**: The hexadecimal table represents the bytes transmitted over the network. 
  
  - The first byte (`02`) represents the `MessageType.RESPONSE`.
  - The next four bytes (`00 00 00 27`) represent the length of the following data payload in bytes.
  - The subsequent bytes encode the chunk ID and the message `"data for chunk Chunk493"`.

- **Client Output**: The client handler decodes the response and prints the chunk ID (`Chunk493`) and the corresponding data (`data for chunk Chunk493`).

This output provides insight into the low-level network operations, showcasing how data is encoded, transmitted, and decoded using Netty's asynchronous and event-driven architecture.

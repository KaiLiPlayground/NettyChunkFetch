Certainly, incorporating the components mentioned in chapter 4.2, the textual representation of the Spark storage system with a focus on the RPC/Netty and shuffle service components would look like this:

```
Driver BlockManager
|
|-- BlockManagerMaster
|   |-- BlockManagerMasterActor (Handles communication with Executor BlockManagers)
|
Executor BlockManager
|
|-- BlockManagerMaster (Communicates with Driver's BlockManagerMasterActor)
|   |-- MemoryStore (Stores blocks in memory)
|   |-- DiskStore (Stores blocks on disk via DiskBlockManager)
|   `-- ShuffleClient (Facilitates shuffle operations, interacts with Netty services)
|       |-- NettyBlockTransferService (Handles block transfers using Netty)
|       |   |-- NettyBlockRpcServer (Provides RPC services for opening/uploading blocks)
|       |   `-- TransportContext (Maintains the context for Netty transport, allows client/server creation)
|       |-- TransportClientFactory (Creates Netty clients for network communication)
|       `-- TransportServer (Netty server that listens for incoming shuffle data requests)
|
|-- DiskBlockManager (Manages block storage on disk)
|-- CacheManager (Manages caching of RDDs)
|-- DiskBlockObjectWriter (Writes blocks to disk)
`-- SortShuffleWriter (Writes shuffle data using a sorting mechanism)
```

In this detailed graph:

- `NettyBlockTransferService` within the `ShuffleClient` manages the actual transfer of blocks using Netty's transport capabilities, with `NettyBlockRpcServer` providing the necessary RPC services for uploading and opening blocks.
- `TransportContext` is a central part of Netty's transport layer, maintaining the context necessary for creating the `TransportClientFactory` and `TransportServer`.
- `TransportClientFactory` is used to create Netty clients that establish connections for block transfers.
- `TransportServer` acts as a Netty server, handling incoming requests for shuffle data and serving as a vital part of the shuffle service in the executor's block manager.

The relationship between these components is critical for the shuffle process in Spark, enabling efficient data transfer across the nodes of a Spark cluster. The `NettyBlockTransferService` in conjunction with `TransportServer` and `TransportClientFactory` allows executors to perform the shuffle operation effectively by transferring intermediate data between map and reduce tasks.

The `BlockManagerMaster` and `BlockManagerMasterActor` have a hierarchical relationship where the `BlockManagerMaster` resides on the driver node and is responsible for managing all the `BlockManager` instances across the cluster. The `BlockManagerMasterActor` is a component within the `BlockManagerMaster` that handles the actual communication with the executor nodes' `BlockManagers` using the actor model.

Here is a textual graph to illustrate their relationship:

```
Driver Node
|
|-- BlockManagerMaster (Responsible for managing BlockManagers)
    |
    |-- BlockManagerMasterActor (Handles communication via messages with BlockManagers on Executors)
        |
        |-- Executor 1 BlockManager (Reports to and receives instructions from BlockManagerMaster)
        |-- Executor 2 BlockManager
        |-- ...
        `-- Executor N BlockManager
```

In this graph:

- The `BlockManagerMaster` on the driver node is the central authority that tracks the state and location of all blocks in the Spark application.
- The `BlockManagerMasterActor` within the `BlockManagerMaster` uses the actor model to asynchronously communicate with each executor's `BlockManager`. Executors register with the `BlockManagerMasterActor` to join the cluster and report on the blocks they hold.
- Each `Executor BlockManager` corresponds to an instance of a Spark executor running on a worker node. It communicates its state and receives commands through messages with the `BlockManagerMasterActor`.

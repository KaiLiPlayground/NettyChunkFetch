To imitate the behavior of fetching 10 MB of data split into 100 blocks (messages), you can start by reading a 10 MB text file from the `src/main/resources` directory, splitting it into smaller chunks, and then sending each chunk as a separate message. This process involves reading the file, splitting it into parts, and handling each part as a distinct `ChunkFetchRequest` and `ChunkFetchResponse`.

Below is a high-level approach to achieve this:

### Step 1: Read and Split the File

First, you need a utility method to read the file and split it into chunks. Assuming each chunk is 100 KB for simplicity (you can adjust the size as needed):

```java
package com.nettychunkfetch.util;

import java.io.IOException;
import java.nio.file.Files;
import java.nio.file.Path;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class FileChunker {
    public static List<byte[]> chunkFile(String filePath, int chunkSize) throws IOException {
        byte[] fileContent = Files.readAllBytes(Path.of(filePath));
        List<byte[]> chunks = new ArrayList<>();

        int start = 0;
        while (start < fileContent.length) {
            int end = Math.min(fileContent.length, start + chunkSize);
            byte[] chunk = new byte[end - start];
            System.arraycopy(fileContent, start, chunk, 0, chunk.length);
            chunks.add(chunk);
            start += chunkSize;
        }

        return chunks;
    }
}
```

### Step 2: Modify Server to Handle Chunked File Requests

You'll need to adjust the server to handle requests for specific chunks. This might involve changing your `ChunkFetchRequest` to include an identifier for the chunk.

### Step 3: Sending Chunk Requests from the Client

Modify the client to request each chunk sequentially or in parallel, depending on your requirements. After receiving all chunks, you can assemble them to recreate the original data.

### Step 4: Testing With a Real File

Place your 10 MB text file in the `src/main/resources` directory and adjust your client/server code to handle the file name as the request and to split/send the file in chunks.

### Example of Sending Requests for Chunks:

```java
// ClientTest.java
// ... inside main or an appropriate method
List<byte[]> chunks = FileChunker.chunkFile("/path/to/your/10mbfile.txt", 1024 * 100); // Adjust path as necessary

// Assuming your client can send byte[] directly, or wrap it in a ChunkFetchRequest
for (int i = 0; i < chunks.size(); i++) {
    client.sendFetchRequest(new ChunkFetchRequest("fileChunk_" + i, chunks.get(i))); // This constructor needs to support byte[]
    // Handle responses...
}
```

This approach requires modification to both the client and server to handle these new types of requests and responses. Ensure that your message encoder/decoder can serialize and deserialize the new request/response types, which include information about the chunk being requested or sent.

Given your requirements and the current implementation, to imitate processing a chunk block of data (especially handling a 10 MB text file split into 100 blocks), you need to adapt the existing structure slightly. You have the basics in place, but to manage the chunks efficiently and tie it all together, consider the following enhancements:

### Enhancements:

1. **File Chunking Utility**: You already have the server and client handlers set up. What's needed next is a utility to read a large file, chunk it, and then send these chunks from the client to the server.

2. **Adapted Server and Client Handlers**: Your handlers are well-positioned to process individual chunks. However, they need to be adapted to process a sequence of chunks, particularly if you're planning to reassemble these on the server side or track the sequence on the client side.

3. **Sequence Information in Messages**: To manage the chunks effectively, especially if they're part of a larger file, include sequence information within your `ChunkFetchRequest` and `ChunkFetchResponse`.

4. **Chunk Assembly on Server**: If the server is supposed to reassemble the chunks, it needs logic to recognize the last chunk and then combine them. This could be done by tracking the sequence numbers or by having a special message indicating the end of transmission.

### Step-by-Step Changes:

1. **Chunking Utility**: Assuming you have a method to chunk the file as mentioned before, use it in your client's main method or wherever you're initiating the file transfer.

2. **Include Sequence Information**:
   
   Modify `ChunkFetchRequest` and `ChunkFetchResponse` to include an integer representing the chunk's sequence number (or a boolean indicating the last chunk).
   
   ```java
   public class ChunkFetchRequest {
       private final String chunkId;
       private final int sequenceNumber; // Or boolean isLastChunk;
       // Constructor, getters, and serialization methods...
   }
   ```
   
   Adjust the serialization/deserialization methods to handle this new field.

3. **Sending Chunks**:
   
   In your client's `sendFetchRequest` method (or a new method dedicated to sending file chunks), loop through each chunk of the file, creating a new `ChunkFetchRequest` for each, and send them sequentially.

4. **Receiving and Processing Chunks on the Server**:
   
   Modify `ServerHandler.channelRead0` to collect chunks. You might use a `Map` to associate each file (or request ID if handling multiple files concurrently) with its chunks. Once you detect the last chunk (via sequence number or a flag), combine them and process the full dataset.

5. **Ensuring Order and Integrity**:
   
   Implement error handling and order checking. TCP ensures packets arrive in order, but it's good practice to verify this, especially if reassembling files or data sequences.

### Example of Adjustments:

Here’s a rough sketch of how you might adjust `ServerHandler.channelRead0` to handle chunk reassembly:

```java
@Override
protected void channelRead0(ChannelHandlerContext ctx, ChunkFetchRequest msg) {
    System.out.println("Server received fetch request for chunk: " + msg.getChunkId() + " Seq: " + msg.getSequenceNumber());
    // Assume dataMap is a class field: Map<String, List<byte[]>> dataMap;
    List<byte[]> chunks = dataMap.computeIfAbsent(msg.getChunkId(), k -> new ArrayList<>());
    chunks.add(msg.getData());

    if (msg.isLastChunk()) {
        // Reassemble file
        byte[] fullData = reassembleFile(chunks);
        System.out.println("File reassembled, size: " + fullData.length);
        // Process full data...
        dataMap.remove(msg.getChunkId()); // Cleanup
    }
}
```

This approach requires adding a flag or sequence information to your messages, adapting serialization/deserialization accordingly, and implementing logic for reassembling and processing the full data set. Consider these sketches as starting points; you’ll need to flesh them out based on your specific application logic and requirements.

after adding the logging handler, from the server end, we see these msg

but we don't see any information relating to the data chunk ID
```

Seeing the log messages from the `LoggingHandler` that show the connection being established (`ACTIVE`) but no further information about the data chunk ID being sent or received suggests a few potential issues:

1. **The message might not be properly encoded or sent by the client.** Since we see a `FLUSH` in the client logs without any preceding message send logs, it's possible the message is either not being encoded into a format that the LoggingHandler recognizes as a send operation, or the message isn't being sent at all.

2. **The server might not be receiving the message due to incorrect message handling or decoding.** If the message is sent but not logged on the server side, it could mean the server's pipeline isn't correctly decoding the message, so it never reaches the handler (or the LoggingHandler as a meaningful message).

### Actions to Investigate Further

- **Ensure the message is being sent:** Verify in the client code that the `ChunkFetchRequest` is created correctly and passed to `writeAndFlush()`. It might be helpful to log right before this operation to ensure it's being reached with the correct data.

- **Check the encoding process:** Confirm that the `MessageEncoder` on the client side is correctly converting your `ChunkFetchRequest` into a `ByteBuf`. You could add debug logs inside the encoder to see if it's being invoked and what data it's writing to the outbound buffer.

- **Verify the decoding process:** Similarly, ensure the `MessageDecoder` on the server side is being triggered and correctly converts the incoming `ByteBuf` back into a `ChunkFetchRequest`. Like with the encoder, adding debug logs can help verify this process.

- **Review the pipeline configuration:** Double-check that the `LoggingHandler`, `MessageDecoder`, and your custom handlers are added to the pipeline in the correct order. The `LoggingHandler` should be one of the first handlers in the pipeline to capture all network activities.

- **Check for any conditional logic in your handlers:** If there's any conditional logic in your handlers that might prevent the processing of certain messages, make sure it's not inadvertently filtering out your `ChunkFetchRequest`.

- **Manual testing with a simple message:** As a diagnostic step, try sending a very simple message (e.g., just a `ByteBuf` with a single byte or string) from the client to see if that gets through and is logged. This can help isolate whether the issue is with the message content/format or with the network communication itself.

Given the log output, it's clear that the connection setup and teardown are happening as expected, but the absence of logs about message sending and receiving points to an issue in the message lifecycle between serialization (encoding) on the client and deserialization (decoding) on the server.

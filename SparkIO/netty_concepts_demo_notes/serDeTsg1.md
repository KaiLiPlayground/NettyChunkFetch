> Since you narrowed down to " the absence of logs about message sending and receiving points to an issue in the message lifecycle between serialization (encoding) on the client and deserialization (decoding) on the server", please suggest how to change the implementation of the serde and the message encoding and decoding parts.

Based on the provided information and the need to troubleshoot the serialization/deserialization and message encoding/decoding process, let's go through a simplified and explicit approach for handling the encoding and decoding of `ChunkFetchRequest` and `ChunkFetchResponse` messages. This approach aims to avoid potential issues related to Java's built-in serialization and deserialization mechanisms, which can be error-prone and not always the best fit for network communication scenarios, especially with frameworks like Netty.

### Simplify Message Serialization/Deserialization

Instead of relying on Java's `ObjectOutputStream` and `ObjectInputStream`, we'll manually serialize and deserialize the `ChunkFetchRequest` and `ChunkFetchResponse` to and from `ByteBuf`, which gives us more control and reduces complexity.

#### Step 1: Modify `ChunkFetchRequest` and `ChunkFetchResponse`

Add serialization and deserialization methods directly to these classes. We'll use simple string encoding for demonstration.

**ChunkFetchRequest.java**

```java
package com.nettychunkfetch.messages;

import io.netty.buffer.ByteBuf;
import io.netty.buffer.Unpooled;

public class ChunkFetchRequest {
    private final String chunkId;

    public ChunkFetchRequest(String chunkId) {
        this.chunkId = chunkId;
    }

    public String getChunkId() {
        return chunkId;
    }

    // Serialize
    public ByteBuf toByteBuf() {
        return Unpooled.wrappedBuffer(this.chunkId.getBytes());
    }

    // Deserialize
    public static ChunkFetchRequest fromByteBuf(ByteBuf byteBuf) {
        byte[] bytes = new byte[byteBuf.readableBytes()];
        byteBuf.readBytes(bytes);
        return new ChunkFetchRequest(new String(bytes));
    }
}
```

**ChunkFetchResponse.java**
Adapt the same pattern for `ChunkFetchResponse`.

#### Step 2: Update the `MessageEncoder` and `MessageDecoder`

The encoder and decoder should now directly call the serialization and deserialization methods of your message classes.

**MessageEncoder.java**

```java
package com.nettychunkfetch.codec;

import com.nettychunkfetch.messages.ChunkFetchRequest;
import com.nettychunkfetch.messages.ChunkFetchResponse;
import io.netty.buffer.ByteBuf;
import io.netty.channel.ChannelHandlerContext;
import io.netty.handler.codec.MessageToByteEncoder;

public class MessageEncoder extends MessageToByteEncoder<Object> {
    @Override
    protected void encode(ChannelHandlerContext ctx, Object msg, ByteBuf out) {
        if (msg instanceof ChunkFetchRequest) {
            ByteBuf buf = ((ChunkFetchRequest) msg).toByteBuf();
            out.writeBytes(buf);
        } else if (msg instanceof ChunkFetchResponse) {
            ByteBuf buf = ((ChunkFetchResponse) msg).toByteBuf();
            out.writeBytes(buf);
        }
    }
}
```

**MessageDecoder.java**
Adapt for both request and response types, checking for some identifier if necessary, to distinguish between them.

#### Step 3: Test Your Implementation

After updating the message classes and encoder/decoder, run your server and client tests again. Ensure that your `NettyServer` and `NettyClient` setup the pipeline correctly to use these new encoders and decoders.

This approach gives you direct control over how messages are encoded into bytes and decoded back into objects, which should help troubleshoot and resolve the issue of messages not being properly received and processed.

Remember to adapt the decoder to differentiate between different message types if your application protocol requires handling multiple message types. You might need to prefix your messages with a type identifier or use a different strategy that suits your specific requirements.

To explain the flow of a shuffle operation in Spark, particularly with the `groupByKey` operation, let's visualize the process through stages, tasks, BlockManagers, and network components. This textual representation will follow a simplified Spark job that involves shuffling data across executors.

```
Stage 1: Map Stage

------------------

[Executor A]                    [Executor B]                     [Executor C]

- (Key1, Value1)                - (Key1, Value4)                 - (Key1, Value7)

- (Key2, Value2)                - (Key2, Value5)                 - (Key2, Value8)

- (Key3, Value3)                - (Key3, Value6)                 - (Key3, Value9)

    |                                |                                 |
    |____                            |____                             |____

         |_______________________________|_______________________________|
                                    |
                              [Shuffle Write]
                                    |

  Stage 2: Shuffle Stage (Shuffle Write & Read)

---------------------------------------------

[BlockManager on Executor A/B/C writes shuffle files locally and registers with its own BlockManager]

Shuffle Data Transfer:

- Executors A, B, and C write shuffle data to their local disk.
- Each executor's BlockManager registers the location of these shuffle files.

Shuffle Read (Preparation for Stage 3):

- BlockManagers coordinate to identify the location of blocks needed for tasks in the next stage.

                                      |
                                      V

  Stage 3: Reduce Stage (groupByKey)

----------------------------------

[Executor A]                      [Executor B]                    [Executor C]

- (Key1, [Value1, Value4,       - (Key2, [Value2, Value5,       - (Key3, [Value3, Value6,
   Value7])                       Value8])                       Value9])

Textual Graph Explanation:

1. **Map Stage**: Initial partitioning of data across Executors A, B, and C. Each executor processes its portion of data, resulting in a key-value pair.

2. **Shuffle Write**: During the map stage completion, each executor writes its output for the shuffle to local storage (managed by the executor's BlockManager). This output is organized in such a way that it can be efficiently read during the shuffle read phase. The BlockManager registers the location of these shuffle files.

3. **Data Transfer**: Not explicitly shown in the graph, this involves the transfer of shuffle data. Executors request shuffle data from each other based on the information provided by the BlockManagers. This is facilitated by Spark's network components using RPC and Netty for efficient data transfer.

4. **Shuffle Read**: Executors read the necessary shuffle data from each other's storage (or from an external shuffle service, if configured). This is prepared for

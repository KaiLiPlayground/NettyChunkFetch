Certainly! Below is a simplified textual graph depicting the interaction between Spark's network classes during a `collect()` operation, where data is sent from executors back to the driver. This graph focuses on the primary components and their relationships within the network layer built on Netty.

```

**Key Points in the Process:**

- **Executor Side:** Executors use `TransportClient` to connect to the driver and send serialized results. `TransportChannelHandler` setups the Netty pipeline, which includes `ChunkFetchRequestHandler` for handling chunk data transfer efficiently. The `MessageEncoder` and `MessageDecoder` are responsible for encoding messages into bytes for the network and decoding them back into objects.

- **Driver Side:** The driver listens for incoming connections and data using `TransportServer`. It uses `RpcEnv` for managing RPC calls, including those from executors sending `collect()` results. The `NettyBlockTransferService` and `ChunkFetchHandler` deal with shuffle data and other large blocks of data being transferred over the network. Like on the executor side, `MessageEncoder` and `MessageDecoder` handle message serialization and deserialization.

This textual graph demonstrates the high-level interaction between Spark's network components, emphasizing the role of Netty in facilitating efficient data communication for distributed computations.

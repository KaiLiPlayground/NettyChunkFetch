Creating textual graphs for both Chapter 3.2 on Spark's RPC (Remote Procedure Call) framework and Chapter 5.3 on the RPC environment within Spark's execution context involves outlining how these components interact with each other and other parts of the Spark ecosystem. 

### Chapter 3.2: RPC Implementation in Spark

The RPC framework in Spark is crucial for enabling communication between different components in a distributed setup. Here's a simplified textual graph representing the key components and their interactions based on Chapter 3.2:

```
  +-----------------------+          +---------------------------+
  | TransportConf         |          | TransportContext          |
  +-----------------------+          +-----------+---------------+
            |                                   |
            | Configuration                     | Initialization
            |                                   |
  +---------v-----------+          +------------v--------------+
  | TransportClientFactory         | TransportServer           |
  +-----------------------+        +---------------------------+
            |                                  |
            | Creates Client                   | Binds Server
            | Instances                        | to Port
            |                                  |
+-----------v-----------+       +--------------v---------------+

+------------------------+       +------------------------------+
            |                                  |
            | Channels Established             | Handle Requests
            | and Managed                      | and Responses
            |

### Chapter 5.3: RPC Environment in Spark's Execution

Chapter 5.3 focuses on the RPC environment, which is pivotal for Spark's internal message passing, especially during the initialization of SparkEnv, the core environment for a Spark application's execution context. Here's a textual graph for Chapter 5.3:

```
  +-------------------+       +-----------------------+
  | SparkEnv          |------>| SecurityManager       |
  +-------------------+       +-----------------------+
            |                           |
            | Initializes               | Controls access
            |                           | and communication
            |                           |
            v                           v
  +---------+----------+       +--------+---------------+
  | RPC Environment    |       | SerializerManager      |
  +--------------------+       +------------------------+
            |                           |
   +--------+--------+          +-------+---------------+
   | TransportContext|          | BroadcastManager      |
   +-----------------+          +-----------------------+
            |                           |
            | Creates                   | Manages Broadcast Variables
            |                           |
   +--------v--------+          +-------v----------------+

            |                           |

            | Endpoints                 |
            |                           |

These textual graphs encapsulate the high-level interactions and flow within Spark's RPC mechanism and the execution environment setup. While the actual implementation details are complex and involve more components, these graphs provide a conceptual overview of the system's architecture.

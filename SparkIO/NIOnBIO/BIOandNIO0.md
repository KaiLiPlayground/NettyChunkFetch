For your presentation slides on BIO, NIO, and RPC, we'll create concise bullet points that encapsulate the essence of each concept, along with a simple textual graph to illustrate the key differences or functionalities. 

### Slide 1: BIO and NIO

#### BIO (Blocking I/O)

- Operates in a synchronous and blocking mode.
- One thread handles one connection.
- More resource-intensive due to thread management.
- Easier to understand and implement for simple applications.

Textual Graph for BIO:

```
Thread 1 → Connection 1
Thread 2 → Connection 2
Thread 3 → Connection 3
```

#### NIO (Non-blocking I/O)

- Supports asynchronous operation and non-blocking mode.
- A single thread can handle multiple connections.
- Efficient for high-volume applications, reducing resource usage.
- Requires a more complex programming model.

Textual Graph for NIO:

```
Thread 1 → Connection 1
       ↘  → Connection 2
         ↘ → Connection 3
```

### Slide 2: RPC (Remote Procedure Call)

- Allows functions to be called on a remote server as if they were local calls.
- Facilitates the development of distributed systems by hiding the complexity of network communication.
- Supports various transport protocols, offering flexibility in application design.
- Incorporates mechanisms for fault tolerance and security.

Textual Graph for RPC:

```
Client Machine      Network      Server Machine
  Caller ──────► RPC Framework ──────► Callee
            [Function Call]        [Function Execution]
```

These bullet points and textual graphs summarize the core aspects of BIO, NIO, and RPC for your presentation slides, aiming to keep each explanation concise and informative.

This graph illustrates the flow of operations from the client machine through the network to the server machine and back, outlining the steps of invocation, marshalling/unmarshalling of parameters, transport layer communication, and the return of results in an RPC operation.

### Slide 1: BIO and NIO Detailed Notes

**BIO (Blocking I/O):**

- **Basics:** Blocking I/O operates in a synchronous manner, meaning the thread that is handling the connection will be blocked, or wait, until there is data to read or write. This is akin to a telephone call where the caller waits for the person on the other line to respond.
- **Usage Scenario:** Ideal for applications with lower concurrency requirements or for simpler server implementations where the overhead of managing numerous threads isn't a concern.
- **Limitations:** The major downside of BIO is its scalability. Each connection requires a dedicated thread; in environments with a large number of connections, the overhead of thread management can significantly degrade performance.

**NIO (Non-blocking I/O):**

- **Basics:** Non-blocking I/O, part of the Java NIO (New Input/Output) package, allows for the management of multiple channels (network connections or files) by a single thread. The thread can switch between channels that are ready for operations (reading, writing, etc.), making it more efficient.
- **Usage Scenario:** NIO shines in high-load, scalable applications, such as web servers or databases, where the number of concurrent connections can be very high, and the cost of dedicating a thread per connection is prohibitive.
- **Key Features:** NIO supports selector objects that can monitor multiple channels for events (like connection opened, data received), allowing one thread to manage multiple connections. This model significantly reduces the resource consumption compared to one-thread-per-connection models.

### Slide 2: RPC (Remote Procedure Call) Detailed Notes

**General Concept:**

- **RPC Mechanism:** The essence of an RPC is to make a procedure call across the network, appear as if it were a local call. This abstraction simplifies the development of distributed applications by hiding the complexities of the network.
- **Enabling Distributed Systems:** RPCs are a foundational technology for distributed systems, allowing them to function as a cohesive system rather than a collection of independent entities.

**Steps Involved:**

1. **Client Stub Invocation:** Acts as a proxy for the server functions on the client side. The application calls a local stub that represents the remote procedure.
2. **Marshalling:** The client stub prepares the call by marshalling, or serializing, the procedure parameters into a format suitable for network transmission.
3. **Transport Layer Communication:** The marshalled data is sent from the client to the server via the network's transport layer.
4. **Server Stub Processing:** Upon receiving the message, the server stub demarshalls the parameters, interprets them, and calls the local server routine as specified.
5. **Response Preparation:** After the server routine completes, the output is marshalled by the server stub and sent back across the network to the client.
6. **Client Stub and Caller Completion:** The client stub receives the response, demarshalls the return values, and the original caller receives the results as if the procedure were executed locally.

**Key Considerations:**

- **Performance and Latency:** The efficiency of an RPC system is often determined by how well it can minimize latency and overhead, making effective marshalling and demarshalling critical.
- **Error Handling:** Robust error handling is essential, as the invocation of remote procedures introduces several failure points not present in local procedure calls.
- **Security:** Secure transmission of data and authentication are paramount, given the distributed nature of the calls.

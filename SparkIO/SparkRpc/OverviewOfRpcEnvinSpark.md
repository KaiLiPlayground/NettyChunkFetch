Chapter 5.3 from "The Art of Spark Kernel Design: Architecture Design and Implementation" discusses the RPC environment within Spark and the transition from using Akka in earlier versions to implementing its own RPC environment (RpcEnv) in Spark 2.x.x versions. Here is a detailed summary:

### Overview of RpcEnv in Spark:

- **RpcEnv** is introduced as a new component in Spark 2.x.x and is designed to replace the Akka dependency used in previous versions of Spark. This change is made to provide more flexibility to users, allowing them to use any version of Akka for their applications. The RpcEnv component must support mechanisms that Akka provided like message sending, synchronization, and at-least-once delivery.

### Creation and Functionality of RpcEnv:

- RpcEnv is created within SparkEnv with specific configuration details including system name, bind address, advertise address, and port. The `RpcEnv.create` method is responsible for the creation process, which eventually calls the `create` method of `NettyRpcEnvFactory`.

### NettyRpcEnvFactory:

- This factory class takes an `RpcEnvConfig` object and constructs an instance of `NettyRpcEnv`, which encompasses the entire Spark RPC framework. The NettyRpcEnv includes the TransportContext, TransportClientFactory, and TransportServer.

### TransportContext:

- TransportContext is created with `TransportConf` and `RpcHandler`. It contains the context needed for creating both the TransportServer and the TransportClientFactory. The `NettyRpcHandler` is the RpcHandler used, and it incorporates a `NettyStreamManager` for managing streams.

### RpcEndpoint and RpcEndpointRef:

- `RpcEndpoint` is an abstract concept in the NettyRpcEnv, representing an entity that can handle RPC requests. `RpcEndpointRef` is the reference to an `RpcEndpoint` and allows remote invocation of RPC calls.

### Dispatcher and Message Loop:

- The Dispatcher is responsible for routing RPC messages to the appropriate `RpcEndpoint`. It manages a queue (`receivers`) where each `EndpointData` contains an `Inbox` of messages to be processed asynchronously by the `MessageLoop`. The MessageLoop continuously processes messages from the `Inbox` of each `EndpointData`.

### TransportClientFactory:

- Two instances of TransportClientFactory are created within NettyRpcEnv: one for general requests and another for file downloading purposes

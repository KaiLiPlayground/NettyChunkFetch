The Spark book "Spark内核设计的艺术：架构设计与实现" and your compiled Spark 3.4 project structure offer insights into Spark's network components and the RPC (Remote Procedure Call) system. Here's a summary based on the mentioned chapters from the book and the structure of your project:

### Spark RPC System Overview

#### Chapter 3.2: RPC System

Chapter 3.2 introduces the RPC system, focusing on its implementation and usage within Spark. It discusses the `TransportClient` class, which offers methods for sending requests, including `fetchChunk`, `stream`, `sendRpc`, `sendRpcSync`, and `send`, with `sendRpc` being the primary method for sending RPC requests. This method ensures that requests are not lost by adhering to the "At least Once Delivery" principle【9:0†source】.

#### Chapter 5.3: RPC Environment

In contrast, Chapter 5.3 delves into the RPC environment, emphasizing the `RpcEnv` component's role in Spark 2.x.x versions. `RpcEnv` acts as a replacement for Akka used in earlier Spark versions for distributed message passing. It is designed to support mechanisms like message sending, synchronous and asynchronous remote calls, and more, which were previously handled by Akka. This chapter covers the creation of `RpcEnv`, including the essential role of `NettyRpcEnvFactory` in its instantiation .

### Spark 3.4 Project Structure

Your project structure reveals two significant subprojects related to Spark's networking:

1. **org.apache.spark.network under spark-network-common_2.12**: Contains `TransportContext.java`, which plays a critical role in Spark's network communication, particularly in managing connections and data transport.

2. **org.apache.spark.network.netty and org.apache.spark.rpc.netty**: These packages likely contain implementations that leverage Netty for network communication. Netty is a high-performance network application framework used by Spark for efficient data transfer and RPC communication.

3. **org.apache.spark.rpc in spark-core_2.12**: Hosts the rest of the RPC-related classes, supporting the core functionalities of Spark's RPC system. This includes classes for managing RPC endpoints, messages, and the overall RPC environment.

### Key Components of Spark's Network

1. **TransportClient**: Essential for sending different types of requests, particularly RPC requests, to the server. It ensures reliability and efficiency in data transport and RPC communication.

2. **RpcEnv**: Acts as the cornerstone for Spark's distributed message system, replacing Akka to provide a unified and optimized framework for message passing, remote calls, and more, supporting both local and remote endpoint communication.

3. **Netty Usage**: The incorporation of Netty into Spark's network architecture, evident from the `org.apache.spark.network.netty` and `org.apache.spark.rpc.netty` packages, underlines Spark's commitment to leveraging efficient, non-blocking I/O for its networking layer. Netty's performance and scalability benefits significantly contribute to Spark's ability to handle distributed data processing tasks.

Combining the insights from the "Spark内核设计的艺术：架构设计与实现" book and the project structure of your compiled Spark 3.4 version, it's clear that Spark's network architecture is sophisticated, leveraging both custom implementations (as seen in the `org.apache.spark.network` package) and third-party frameworks like Netty to provide a robust, scalable, and efficient RPC system. This system supports the high-performance requirements of distributed computing tasks, facilitating communication and data exchange across the components of the Spark ecosystem.
